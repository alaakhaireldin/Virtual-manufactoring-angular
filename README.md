# Recreating virtual manufacturing project using Angular and TypeScript

The goal of this project is to rebuild an existing Express.js project with a user interface that allows users to create and add new project items to a list. Angular will be used as the technology for this project. The steps to complete this project include installing and setting up Angular, creating a new Angular project, building a user interface component, establishing a service to communicate with the backend API, implementing form validation, and testing and continuing development of the project. Additionally, the project requires setting up a backend API and database to store project items, and implementing any necessary authentication and authorization measures.
